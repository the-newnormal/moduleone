# working tree and push the current branch to GitHub. Each response is a
# checkpoint, so unfinished work is pushed too (squash-merge the PR).
#
# Guardrails (see CLAUDE.md):
#   - never commits or pushes on main/master or off a local branch
#   - never commits .env/key/credential files (only .env.example is allowed)
#     or files containing token-shaped secrets
#   - never pushes unpushed commits (e.g. ones Claude made itself, merges
#     included) that touch such files or tokens or carry a token in their
#     message; those, and octopus merges, are left for a manual push
#   - skips while a merge/rebase/cherry-pick is in progress or a conflict is
#     unresolved
#   - never force-pushes and never skips git hooks (pre-push hooks get 60 s)
#   - pushes only the branch commit it scanned: no tags, submodule commits or
#     git-lfs objects
#   - leaves nested repositories (e.g. Claude's .claude/worktrees/) uncommitted
