# moduleone

Normal's **team-health tool** — Module 1 of the Normal internal stack.

A weekly ~5-minute **360 check-in** (voice) scoring **Activity · Excellence · Morale**, transcribed and LLM-graded, rolled into a **Red/Yellow/Green heat-map** across teams and weeks. Built shallow + manual-input-first as a ~3-month stopgap.

## Stack
Next.js (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind + shadcn/ui · Supabase (Postgres + Auth, RLS) · Vercel. Reviewed by CodeRabbit; Greptile for codebase intel.

## Dev
```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # fill in Supabase keys
pnpm supabase start               # local Postgres
pnpm supabase db reset            # apply migrations + seed
pnpm dev
```

## Rules
See `CLAUDE.md` for the engineering contract. Hygiene is non-negotiable: protected `main`, migrations-in-Git, RLS on every table, CI + required Supabase migration check + an approving review before merge (CodeRabbit's counts). Claude merges PRs once they're green. **No direct production changes. No merging past red CI or unticked pre-merge steps.**
